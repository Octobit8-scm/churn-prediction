# churn-prediction
## Overview
Churn prediction helps telecommunications companies identify customers at risk of leaving their services, enabling targeted interventions to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.
## Objective: 
Predict and prevent customer churn by identifying high-risk customers and implementing retention strategies.
## Data Sources
-	Customer service logs.
-	Call data records (CDRs).
-	Billing information.
-	Customer interactions and feedback.
## Implementation Steps
### 1.	Data Collection
-	Integrate customer data from CRM systems, billing platforms, and call center logs.
### 2.	Data Cleaning
-	Address missing values using imputation techniques.
-	Remove or handle outliers in variables.
-	Normalize variables for consistency in modeling.
### 3.	Feature Engineering
-	Create relevant features, such as:
  	- Service usage patterns (e.g., average call duration, data usage).
    - Number of customer support calls.
    - Payment delays or irregular billing history.
### 4.	Model Development
-	Use supervised machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression or XGBoost.
-	Train the model to classify customers as high-risk or low-risk for churn.
### 5.	Deployment
-	Deploy the churn prediction model into the customer retention system.
-	Trigger automated interventions like personalized offers, loyalty programs, or follow-up calls for high-risk customers.

### 6.	Monitoring and Maintenance
-	Track model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
-	Continuously refine and retrain the model using updated customer data.
## Tools and Technologies
#### Python: 
- Libraries like pandas and scikit-learn for data analysis and modeling.
#### SQL: 
- For querying and managing customer data.
#### Tableau: 
- For visualizing churn trends and insights.
